**Python Scaffold-Highlighter**

Subtitle: An HCI-based approach to teaching Python in the Age of AI.

**📌 Overview**

This tool was developed as part of my Master’s Thesis, "Programming Pedagogy in the Age of Accessible Artificial Intelligence." It is designed to assist novice programmers—specifically in remote and First Nation communities—in transitioning from block-based logic (Scratch) to text-based logic (Python).

**🛠 Features**

Dynamic Nesting Visualization: Automatically detects indentation levels and applies a background highlight.

Logic Scaffolding: Helps students identify where a block begins and ends, reducing "IndentationErrors."

HCI Optimized: Designed based on cognitive load theory to ensure the UI supports, rather than distracts from, the learning process.

**📊 Research Integration**

This highlighter can be used for middle school students.

Chapter 3 Focus: Improving CT (Computational Thinking) through blended learning.

**Metric:**
Used to measure the reduction in syntax errors and improvement in "time-to-first-success" during coding tasks.
